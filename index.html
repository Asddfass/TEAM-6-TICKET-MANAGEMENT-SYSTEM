        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>
          Our Ticketing Management System is designed to make requesting and tracking school-related assistance easier and more efficient. Instead of relying on emails or phone calls, faculty members can quickly submit requests for repairs, support, or any issues they encounter within the school. The system ensures that each request is reviewed, processed, and assigned to the appropriate team for resolution. With real-time updates and notifications, faculty can easily track the status of their requests, ensuring timely and organized support. Our mission is to simplify the process, improve communication, and help resolve issues faster, keeping the school running smoothly.
